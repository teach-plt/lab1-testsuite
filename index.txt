= Introduction =

Before you submit [lab 1 ../index.html], your solution must pass the
testsuite. This document describes how to obtain and use
this testsuite.

= Preparations =

You will only need to do this part once.


+ Download [lab1-testsuite.tar.gz lab1-testsuite.tar.gz].

+ Unpack the downloaded file:
```
$ tar -xzf lab1-testsuite.tar.gz
```

+ Enter the ``lab1-testsuite`` directory:
```
$ cd lab1-testsuite
```

+ Compile the test program with ``make``, or alternatively:

```
$ ghc -threaded --make -o plt-test-lab1 plt-test-lab1.hs
```


= Running the testsuite =

This is what you need to do to test your grammar.


+ Enter the ``lab1-testsuite`` directory (if you are not there already):
```
$ cd lab1-testsuite
```

+ Run the ``plt-test-lab1`` with the path to your ``.cf`` file:
```
$ ./plt-test-lab1 path/to/your/file.cf
```

where ``path/to/your/file.cf`` is the location of your
grammar file.


**NOTE:** The start category (entry point) of your grammar
must be called ``Program``.
